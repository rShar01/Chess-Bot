# Chess-Bot
A python algorithm that can play chess using the python-chess library. It's not fantastic but it is able to make satisfactory moves.

I used the Python Chess libarary to generate moves and to manually make them (found here https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core.html#board)

I reccomend using push_sans to make moves as it is closer to usualy chess convention.
