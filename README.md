A python algorithm that can play chess using the python-chess library. It's not fantastic but it is able to make satisfactory moves.

I used the Python Chess library to generate a chessboard for the algorithm to examine (found here https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core.html#board)

The algorithm takes any legal position and outputs what it thinks the best move is.

I reccomend using push_sans to make moves as it is closer to usual chess convention.
